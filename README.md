# Assorted Core

The core mod that all of the other Assorted Mods depend on. Contains reusable blocks and items as
well as provides reusable code for the other mods.

Minecraft 26.2, on both NeoForge and Fabric from a single source tree. Requires
[Assorted Lib](https://github.com/grim3212/AssortedLib). Branches are per Minecraft version; `26.2`
is the current one.

## Issue Reporting

Please include the following

* Minecraft version
* Loader and its version — NeoForge, or Fabric Loader together with Fabric API
* Assorted Core version
* Assorted Lib version
* The full `latest.log`, plus the crash report if the game crashed

## Building

JDK 25 and the bundled Gradle wrapper. `common/` holds the loader-agnostic code; both loader
modules compile those sources inline rather than depending on a common jar, so there is nothing to
install between them.

How the build works - the Minecraft and loader versions, the runs, the tests, publishing - lives in
[AssortedBuild](https://github.com/grim3212/AssortedBuild), pinned by `assortedbuild_version` in
`gradle.properties`. This repository only says what the mod is.

Assorted Lib is consumed as a Maven artifact, so publish it first:

```bash
cd ../AssortedLib && ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Then from this repository:

```bash
./gradlew build                        # every module; jars land in <module>/build/libs
./gradlew :neoforge:runClient
./gradlew :fabric:runClient
./gradlew :neoforge:runGameTestServer  # headless gametests, non-zero exit on failure
./gradlew :fabric:runGameTest
./gradlew :neoforge:runClientData      # datagen
./gradlew :neoforge:runServerData
./gradlew :fabric:runDatagenClient
```

Generated resources are committed. Datagen output is regenerated, never hand-edited.
`TESTING-CHECKLIST.md` lists the in-game checks the gametests cannot cover.
